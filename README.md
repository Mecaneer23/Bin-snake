# Bin-snake
Bin-snake is an Esolang - in short, it is a wrapper for Python, in binary.

Bin-snake executes binary to Python code. The easiest way to run it is to use compiler.py. Simply create your .bs file and run compiler.py. Python must be present on your system to compile.

When you eventually give up, feel free to write a Bin-snake program in Python, and then write to Bin-snake using writer.py.

If you need some help getting started, take a look at the hello world programs in Examples/.
