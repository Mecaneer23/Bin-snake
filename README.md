# Bin-snake
Bin-snake is an Esolang - in short, it is a wrapper for Python, in binary.

Bin-snake executes Python code, written in binary. 

## Running
The easiest way to run a Bin-snake file is with a compiler. Note: a Bin-snake file must use the (.bs) file extension.
In this repo, I have provided two similar Bin-snake compilers (see below). If you are on a Windows computer, you can also use the latest executable file, which can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Mecaneer23/Bin-snake/releases).
```
  compile.py
  compile.js
```
The only difference in the files is the language used to create it. 

## Cheating
When you eventually give up, feel free to write a Bin-snake program in Python, and then write to Bin-snake using writer.py.

## Examples
If you need some help getting started, take a look at the hello world programs in [Examples](https://github.com/Mecaneer23/Bin-snake/tree/main/Examples).
