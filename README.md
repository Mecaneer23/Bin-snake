# Bin-snake
Bin-snake is an Esolang - in short, it is a wrapper for Python, in binary.

Bin-snake executes Python code, written in binary. 

## Running
The easiest way to run a Bin-snake file is with a runner (or compiler/interpreter - I am using the terms loosely). Note: a Bin-snake file must use the (.bs) file extension.
In this repo, I have provided a Bin-snake [runner](https://github.com/Mecaneer23/Bin-snake/blob/main/runner.py) (`runner.py`). 

If you are on a Windows computer, you can also use the latest executable file, which can be found under [Releases](https://github.com/Mecaneer23/Bin-snake/releases). If Windows Defender tries to delete the file because it is "dangerous", either press `allow` or in the Windows Defender application, press `do nothing` and save.

## Cheating
When you eventually give up, feel free to write a Bin-snake program in Python, and then write to Bin-snake using writer.py.

## Examples
If you need some help getting started, take a look at the hello world programs in [Examples](https://github.com/Mecaneer23/Bin-snake/tree/main/Examples).
